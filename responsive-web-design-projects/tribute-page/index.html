                <h3>Here's a timeline of Vishy Anand's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1983</strong> – The year when India when the cricket world cup was also the time another
                        legend was in
                        the
                        making. Just as a 14-year-old boy, Anand managed to turn heads towards his side and fetch early
                        recognition and attention by winning the national sub-junior chess championship.</li>

                    <li><strong>1984</strong> –The location is Coimbatore and the event is the Asian Junior Chess
                        Championship but the
                        result
                        was the same- Viswanathan Anand. Yet again, Anand won the championship and ultimately became
                        the
                        first Indian to bag the International Master Norm title.</li>

                    <li><strong>1985</strong> – Anand went to Hong Kong for another edition of the Asian Junior Chess
                        Championship and
                        again
                        emerged victorious. He was also awarded the honorable Arjuna Award for chess in this year.</li>

                    <li><strong>1986</strong> – After the national sub-junior chess championship, it was time for Anand
                        to eye for the
                        next
                        big Indian title. He did! He won the national chess championship and retained the title for the
                        following two consecutive years.</li>

                    <li><strong>1987</strong> – Anand emerged victorious at the World Junior Chess Championship and went
                        on to become the
                        first ever Indian to earn the prestigious title.</li>

                    <li><strong>1988</strong> – This was probably the most remarkable year in his timeline as it was in
                        1988 when the
                        Grandmaster was awarded with the prestigious Padma Shri. In the same year, he also became
                        India’s
                        first Grandmaster.</li>

                    <li><strong>1991</strong> – Viswanathan Anand was awarded with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>2000</strong> – Fast forward a decade, when the world was facing the Y2k crisis, Anand
                        was fighting his
                        own.
                        However, like always, he tackled in his own ways and emerged as the winner of the FIDE World
                        Chess
                        Championship.</li>

                    <li><strong>2001</strong> – The onset of the new century brought with it the title of Padma Bhushan
                        in 2001.</li>

                    <li><strong>2007</strong> – It was Mexico City, where the FIDE World Chess Championship was held and
                        this time, Anand
                        entered as the top ranked player in the world. Scoring 9 out of 14pt, Anand emerged victorious
                        yet
                        again.</li>

                    <li><strong>2008</strong> – In a yet another proud moment, Viswanathan Anand received the much
                        deserved Padma
                        Vibhushan
                        Award in 2008.</li>

                    <li><strong>2010</strong> – The championship was to be held at Sofia and Anand had booked his flight
                        tickets to the
                        place
                        via Frankfurt. However, volcanic ash clouds from Eyjafjallajökull resulted in the cancellation
                        of
                        most flights including that of Anand’s. His permissions to postpone the event went in vain.</li>
                    <p>However, he decided to reach Sofia after a 40-hour road journey and participated in the
                        championship. While most people consider reaching the tournament a victory, Anand went on to win
                        the tournament as well.</p>
                    <li><strong>2017</strong> – Last year, Anand defeated Vladimir Fedoseev and won the World Rapid
                        Chess Championship.
                    </li>
                    <p>Tons of recognitions, awards and felicitations and countless victories but what makes Viswanathan Anand one of the greatest is the way he has handled fame and success. Despite reaching great heights, he has stayed humble to the game and retained his composure at every possible levels. Though we can take inspiration to play chess better from Anand, what we must take away before is the lesson on tasting excellence and staying humble. Long live the Grandmaster!</p>

                    <p>"I always considered him to be a colossal talent, one of the greatest in the whole history of chess"; and "I think that in terms of play Anand is in no way weaker than Kasparov but he's simply a little lazy, relaxed and only focuses on matches. In the last 5–6 years he's made a qualitative leap that's made it possible to consider him one of the great chess players."</p>
